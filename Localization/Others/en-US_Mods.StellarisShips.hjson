	ShipStat0: Ship Size represents the maintenance cost of the ship, and the sum of all ship sizes cannot exceed the Fleet Capacity.
	ShipStat1: Hull represents how much damage a ship can take before being completely destroyed.
	ShipStat2: Defense value represents the damage reduction effect of the ship, which is consistent with the player's defense algorithm.It can be increased through Armor.
	ShipStat3: Shield is the first line of defense to protect the ship, and can absorb part of the attack before it causes damage to the ship.
	ShipStat4: Hull Regen determines how quickly a ship can restore its Hull.
	ShipStat5: Shield Regen determines how quickly a ship can restore its Shield when not in combat. It can be increased through Components such as Shield.
	ShipStat6: All ships can dodge attacks, reducing the damage they take. The chance of dodge can be increased by Components such as Thrusters, but the larger the ship, the less effective it is.
	ShipStat7: Speed ​​is the maximum speed a ship can move in combat.It can be increased by Thrusters and other Components. When a fleet is moving, the slowest ship will limit the maximum speed of the entire fleet.
	ShipStat8: Detection Radius determines the radius within which the ship will attack enemies within a certain range of the player/rally point.It can be increased through Sensor.
	ShipStat9: The higher the Aggro, the more likely enemies will attack that ship, and ignore other ships and the player.
	ShipStat10: DPS is the sum of the damage values ​​of all Weapon Components equipped on the ship. Each Weapon will attack independently in combat. DPS should not be used to unilaterally evaluate the attacking ability of a ship.
	ShipStat11: Ship Role determines its behavior when attacking and its Weapon usage tendencies.It is determined by Combat Computer.
	ShipStat12: Cost determines the cost required to build a ship. The Cost of a Ship is equal to the sum of the cost of the Ship and the cost of all the Components it equips.
