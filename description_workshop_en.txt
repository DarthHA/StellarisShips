This mod adds ships and weapons from the strategy game "Stellaris", and it's quite op.
Mod progress:
After defeating the Eye of Cthulhu, a space communicator will definitely drop. After using it, you can contact the Modifiers Association and spend coins to commission them to customize ships.
Ships are independent units with similar behaviors to summons, but they will attract enemy hatred when attacking, and also have attributes such as life.
Ships have sections and parts. Different sections can carry different parts. Parts can improve the properties of ships and provide new weapons and features.
Note that ships are bound to the world, which means that the same player will not be able to take ships away when switching worlds.
The upper limit of ships is limited, and the upper limit will increase with the progress of the game.
When a certain progress is reached, new ship types and parts will be unlocked.
As for the rest, it is recommended to explore it yourself.

Sprite and sound assets are from Stellaris.
Multiplayer games are not supported.
